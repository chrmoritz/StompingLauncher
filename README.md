**The Stomping Launcher** is a tool for the dinosaur survival game [The Stomping Land](http://www.thestompingland.com/) with the aim of making joining and hosting servers easier for those not familiar with command line parameters. It as well provides functionality for editing solo and server save files.

### 2. Host your Own Server
* auto setup of Port Forwarding (requires router with [UPnP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play) support)
* easily change your server configuration by (un)checking checkboxes:
  * enable/disable friendly fire, show all player names and remove dinosaurs
* simply edit host options like:
  * hostname, port, public (steam) visibility, steam query port and choose a custom configuration directory
  * change slots / max players counts
* multipe server start options:
  * normal (the default one without something special)
  * auto restart after crash (The Stomping Launcher monitors your server and restarts it, when its crashed / not responding)
  * creative mode (the server will restart after a set amount of time and give all players full equip (expertise/herbs/weapons/ammo), PvE recommended)
* ability to auto-join your server on startup (if you host it on a local PC)
* support for multiple server profiles (save and load your server configurations)
